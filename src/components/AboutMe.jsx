        I am a recent UNSW graduate and a lover of learning and technology. I've
        studied and worked across diverse fields ranging from AI to
        Cybersecurity. Beyond tech, I'm into perfecting my craft through BJJ,
        Muay Thai, Boxing, and weightlifting. I find that keeping active helps
        me not only physically but also improves my mood and mental clarity.
